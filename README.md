# PXRD-peak-pos
* Cellulose Ibeta XRD peak positions were calculated from the general interplanar spacing (d) equation (triclic). Another from the monoclinic eqn.
* The peak position changes upon variation in lattice parameter (a, b, gamma) were plotted. 

* This was developped to check the Rietveld analysis results.
* Reference for the parameters used: J. AM. CHEM. SOC. 2002, 124, 9074-9082
